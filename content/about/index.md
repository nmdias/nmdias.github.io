## Nuno Manuel Dias

I am originally from Portugal, now living in Croatia as a remote software engineer.  
I have interacted with a wide-range of technologies.  
I am experienced in some and **I specialized around native iOS development with Swift**.  
I have roots in graphic design.  

#### What I'm doing right now

- Finalizing XMLKit for public release
- Exploring all things Swift
- Developing and maintaining full stack production systems with .NET and SQL
- Freshening up this website

#### Technologies

`swift` `obj-c` `rx` `fastlane` `travis` `github actions` `spm` `cocoapods` `carthage` `c` `c#` `.net mvc` `.net web api` `sql server` `xamarin` `java` `hugo` `git` `html/css` `java_script` `jquery` `php` `mysql` `photoshop` `illustrator` `after_effects` `indesign` `sketch`

As you might have guessed, **I’m nowhere near proficient in all of the above**. I just had the opportunity to work on at least one project that made **meaningful usage of these technologies**. And while these **don't reflect where I’m going, they show where I’ve been**.
